## Abstract

The conventional vapour compression AC system in automobiles relies on engine
output for compressor work.  The energy associated with shock absorber action,
is lost as viscous dissipation in conventional systems. By replacing this shock
absorber to act as a reciprocating air compressor, to drive an air conditioning
system, we can avoid the dependence on engine power.  Based on theoretical
calculations on Reversed Brayton cycle, it has been found that, it is possible
to achieve a cooling capacity of 1 Ton of Refrigeration, with a COP of 2.71.
For this we require the modified shock absorber to generate an air pressure of
3 bar after compression.

A Maruti 800 rear shock absorber is modified to act as a reciprocating air
compressor. This is done by replacing the damping components within the shock
absorber cylinder, with a piston head. An inlet and a delivery port are drilled
into the cylinder.  The shock absorber is firmly mounted on a frame. It is then
driven using a cam powered by an electric motor.  The compressed air is stored
in a reservoir at a pressure of 3 bar and temperature higher than ambient
condition.  Then, the air is passed into heat exchanger to reject heat to
ambient air, isobarically.  To achieve the drop in temperature, the high
pressure air is expanded using a cooling turbine, isentropically. Air pressure
drops to atmospheric pressure, and the temperature is below ambient condition.
The refrigerating capacity of the cooled air per unit mass, and COP of the
system has to be evaluated experimentally.
